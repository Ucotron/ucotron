# Sync to Pro — Notify ucotron-pro after successful OSS deploy
# =============================================================================
# Triggers a repository_dispatch event in ucotron-pro, which then fetches
# the latest OSS changes and opens a PR for review.
#
# This runs AFTER the Deploy workflow succeeds, ensuring we only sync
# code that has been built and deployed successfully.
#
# Required secrets:
#   PRO_SYNC_PAT — A GitHub Personal Access Token (classic) with `repo` scope,
#                  created by an account that has write access to both
#                  Ucotron/ucotron and Ucotron/ucotron-pro.
#                  Fine-grained tokens need: Contents (read) + Actions (write)
#                  on Ucotron/ucotron-pro.
